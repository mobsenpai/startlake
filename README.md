## installing

### firefox

regular firefox requires extensions to be [signed](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/publish/signing-and-distribution-overview/). firefox nightly does not require signing. 

1. go to `about:addons`.
2. click the gear icon in the top right.
3. click "Install Add-on From File..."
4. select `index.zip` from this repo (if you are using nightly) or the `.xpi` file (if you are using regular firefox and have signed the extension).
5. create a new tab. if it asks you, select "Keep Changes".

bonus: install the firefox color extension and use [this theme](https://color.firefox.com/?theme=XQAAAAK6AgAAAAAAAABBqYhm849SCicxcUEYWXcGHf3p79Ffm1p9Wc4wq53dKzq9lNGpZo8BuIsCkVkhGB-b71b_bH2GAn3WyUogVaz_7oMq3PdWBi1tWXc0s4NIAQJS28Fxe8MjMBa4kcq36Ap2Us_AykwqbGWT3hsVv7qSFMrFjAsHv3iRAYPPHY3TpdofkQjV7e6OjSzNQH5yVQRuXnnFhwwrQDYia_UIdBvjbErAMtrQh1v2_ova4_704BscrUZgYcyMx7CH_oR3VhNm4jn-xIiWEHn19HoT-4Vb2lUkMOTCdqdi-K-tp_x3HLIaCHBxDqK2b-EHYv90tRBKTi-EHnrEJxop91Od_oa1FDlwy5_XEqu-sSjioq-zb94BuJ5Pr9S300fE_ZYk8z3_WJIjAA) for matching firefox colors.

### chrome

currently it doesn't work on chrome, but it shouldn't be too hard to modify.

## notes

you can open the settings by clicking the hidden gear button in the top right corner. settings are stored in localstorage. the settings will automatically be visible if you do not have anything set.
